this is the art piece i made today;
It is based on an anime scene where a character chalanges the other to a fire
fighting, which in this case is quite literal since he is shooting a fire arrow
at him. Now that i explained what it is supposed to be i will comment a little
bit on the actual drawing. Honestly i think i looks realy good specialy the
hand, usualy the hand is realy hard to get right but i think i nailed it, if
you are wondering yes his hand is supposed to be upside down that how it is in
the manga. If you have a keen eye you will see that there is no face on my
drawing i tried but i just had a hard time with the angle so a fail for now, but
that just means i have some more things to work on, like there is not enogh
thing to get good at, and continue to keep you up to date with.
